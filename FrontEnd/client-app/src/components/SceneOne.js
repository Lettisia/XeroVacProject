            <p>You wake up at desk after long and restless night. It is 2nd November, the Day of the Dead. It is also the anniversary of your partner’s death - former Sheriff Theodore.</p>
            <p>In the town gaol is the town drunk, Clayton. He was locked up for disturbing the peace.  He has been yelling, “I have seen the ghost of the Cowboy Killer!”
            You answer, “That’s impossible, she’s been dead for a year! Killed by my father!”</p>

            <p>You then ignore the drunk and gets on with some work.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, Cowboy Johnny bursts into the room. He says he has heard screaming by the Spooky House, the home of Old Lady Dolores. </p>
            <p>You leave the office to the Spooky House, with the keys to the gaol cell still in your hand...</p>
