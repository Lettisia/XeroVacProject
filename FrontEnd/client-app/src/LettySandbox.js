            <p>You wake up at desk after long restless night. It is the anniversary of your partner’s death - Theodore, the former Sheriff’s. It is 2nd November, the Day of the Dead. You have just locked up the town drunk  in the jail cell. He keeps yelling, “I have seen the ghost of the Cowboy Killer!”

You answer, “That’s impossible, he’s been dead for a year! Killed by my father, Theodore...”
He then ignores the drunk and gets on with some work...
